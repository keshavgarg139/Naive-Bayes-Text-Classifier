A religion is a particular system of belief about how superhuman forces, such as a god or gods, control the universe as well as setting down practices for worshiping or acknowledging those forces. But how do members of a religion know what their beliefs and practices are? One of the main ways is to write them down.

Religious writings play a major part in all of the world's major religions. They record the religion's beliefs, practices, and history and guide current behavior. However, different religions incorporate religious writings differently.
