Christianity grew out of Judaism and also considers the Tanakh to be a sacred text, though the refer to it as the Old Testament. It is joined by the New Testament, a collection of writings about the life of Jesus and his first followers, to form the Christian Holy Bible. The four books known as the Gospels record Jesus' life, while much of the rest of the New Testament is made up of letters from St. Paul, an early convert, which helped to establish the beliefs and practices of the early Christian church.
